General notes from previous reviews:
? "I" vs "we" vs passive. 
  - I was trying to cmpletely avoid 1st person sentences... I also read some reviews of Mr. Pelikan and it does not seem like a good idea... :(

- structure:
  - "1 Introduction"
    ? structured: Why SCA, Why in kentico, mention existing tool and its problems, How this can be solved? Just quiclky mention Roslyn.. My contribution - BugHunter Roslyn Analyzers - already deployed.. describe the structure
  
  ? "2 Background -- Compiling Source Code" -- rename?? source code compilaion??s
    - in the beginning explain why this chapter is important for the rest of the thesis
  
  - "3 Static code analysis"
    ? other sources about SCA???    
    ? 3.1 I was planning to do my own version of this diagramm, with security knowledge renamed to "(Predefined) Rules".. can it reffer to the book (citation)???
    ? flaw, issue, problem, bug ??? -- delete "flaw"
    - add mention that the end of the chapter contains .NET options for SCA
    
  - "4 The .NET Compiler Platform"
    ? are the newly added sections okay?
    ! Code snippet in tex and just analyze method()
    
  - "5 Implementation of Custom Analyzers"
    ? categories - is the table okay? 
    ? should there be a brief explanation that categories are defined in this way because of historical reasons?
    ? "API Replacement Analyzer", Method Invocation Analyzer .... what to do with the sections???
    
    - Member Replacement Analyzer 
     ? yes it is a strategy, should it be mentioned explicitely? - just say it is!
     
    - Method Invocation Analyzer 
     ? Method Name Syntax Analysis - should there be an example + graph for every case?
  
  - "6 Measuring and Optimizing Performance"

  - "7 Conclusion"  
    ? can I put there some my general notes about the Roslyn API??
      - like lack of proper updated documentation, version 1.3.2 containing crutial enhancements...
    
  - "Appendices"
    ? Is it okay like this?
    
Performance measurements:
- how much should I analyze the performance results? Trimmed average is enough or add also some boxplot? table with results? graph?
- should there be some pseudo activity diagram displaying the flow of Report-Analyzer.ps1?

Performance optimizations:
- show the measurement results, in what form for should they be presented (trimmedmean in table? boxplots??)
- is it okay to only analyzer the optimizations of SystemIO and the others will be just mentioned?

Questionnaire format:
- you have to define the goals of the questionnaire first.. then analyze the results
